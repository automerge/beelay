# Beelay

This repository contains an experimental implementation of a new sync protocol for Automerge. In fact, because one of the goals of the project is to produce a sync protocol which allows end-to-end encryption of the document data this protocol will work for any data structure which likes being represented as a hash-linked DAG of changes.

See [protocol.md]( docs/protocol.md ) for a more detailed description of how it works.

## Status

This is very much a work in progress, expect things to be very broken and to change significantly before we're done.
